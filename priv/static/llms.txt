# Hermes MCP - Model Context Protocol Implementation for Elixir

Hermes MCP is a comprehensive Elixir framework for building Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and clients. It provides a robust, OTP-compliant implementation that enables language models to interact with external tools, resources, and data sources through a standardized protocol.

## Overview

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables language models to securely access tools and data sources. Hermes brings this capability to the Elixir ecosystem with:

- **Full MCP Specification Support**: Implements the complete MCP protocol including tools, resources, prompts, and sampling
- **Multiple Transport Layers**: STDIO, Server-Sent Events (SSE), WebSocket, and HTTP streaming
- **OTP Architecture**: Built on GenServer with proper supervision trees for fault tolerance
- **Declarative APIs**: Simple DSL for defining servers and clients without boilerplate
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive validation using Peri schemas
- **Production Ready**: Telemetry, structured logging, and graceful shutdown handling

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **MCP Protocol Layer** (`Hermes.MCP`)
   - Message encoding/decoding for JSON-RPC 2.0
   - Standardized error handling
   - Request/response correlation
   - Batch request support

2. **Transport Abstraction** (`Hermes.Transport`)
   - Pluggable transport layers
   - Session management
   - Message routing
   - Connection lifecycle

3. **Server Framework** (`Hermes.Server`)
   - Declarative server definition
   - Component registration (tools, prompts, resources)
   - Request/notification handling
   - Session isolation

4. **Client Framework** (`Hermes.Client`)
   - High-level client DSL
   - Request pipeline with timeouts
   - Progress tracking
   - Batch operations

### Key Design Principles

- **Immutability**: State is never mutated, always returned from callbacks
- **Supervision**: Every component is supervised for fault tolerance
- **Validation**: All inputs validated with Peri schemas
- **Observability**: Comprehensive telemetry and logging
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add custom transports and components

## Quick Start

### Creating an MCP Server

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.MCPServer do
  use Hermes.Server,
    name: "my-app",
    version: "1.0.0",
    capabilities: [:tools, :resources, :prompts]
    
  # Register components
  component MyApp.Calculator
  component MyApp.FileReader
  component MyApp.CodePrompt
  
  # Optional: Handle optinal initialization
  def init(_client_infp, frame) do
    {:ok, frame}
  end
end
```

### Creating an MCP Client

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.AnthropicClient do
  use Hermes.Client,
    name: "MyApp", 
    version: "1.0.0",
    protocol_version: "2025-06-18"
end

# Start in supervision tree
children = [
  {MyApp.AnthropicClient,
   transport: {:stdio, command: "uvx", args: ["mcp-server-anthropic"]}}
]

# Use the client
{:ok, tools} = MyApp.AnthropicClient.list_tools()
{:ok, result} = MyApp.AnthropicClient.call_tool("search", %{query: "elixir"})
```

## Component Types

### Tools
Execute functions with structured inputs and outputs. Tools allow models to perform actions like calculations, API calls, or system operations.

### Resources
Provide data that models can read. Resources are identified by URIs and return content in various formats (text, JSON, images, etc).

### Prompts
Offer reusable templates that can be customized with arguments. Prompts help standardize common interaction patterns.

## Transport Options

- **STDIO**: For subprocess communication
- **SSE**: Server-Sent Events over HTTP
- **WebSocket**: Full-duplex WebSocket connections (client only)
- **StreamableHTTP**: HTTP with request/response streaming (most common)

## Advanced Features

- **Batch Operations**: Send multiple requests in a single message
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor long-running operations
- **Sampling Support**: Servers can request LLM completions from clients
- **Dynamic Registration**: Register/unregister components at runtime
- **Session Management**: Isolated sessions with configurable timeouts
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Proper cleanup of resources and connections

## Best Practices

1. **Use Components**: Organize tools, prompts, and resources as separate component modules
2. **Validate Inputs**: Define schemas for all component inputs
3. **Handle Errors**: Use standardized MCP errors for consistency
4. **Monitor Performance**: Leverage telemetry events for observability
5. **Test Thoroughly**: Use the provided test framework for comprehensive testing

## Integration

Hermes MCP servers can be integrated with:
- Claude Desktop (via stdio transport)
- Custom LLM applications (via HTTP/WebSocket)
- Development tools and IDEs
- Data processing pipelines
- External APIs and services

The framework handles all protocol details, letting you focus on implementing your domain logic while ensuring compatibility with the MCP ecosystem.
